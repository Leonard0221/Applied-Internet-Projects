# Crazy Eights Card Game in JavaScript

## Introduction

Welcome to the Crazy Eights card game in JavaScript! Crazy Eights is a classic and exciting game that is perfect for players of all ages. The game is played with a standard deck of 52 cards, and the objective is to be the first player to get rid of all their cards.

In this implementation, we have created a simple text-based version of the Crazy Eights game that you can play in your browser's console. The game allows multiple players to participate and follows the standard Crazy Eights rules.

## Rules of the Game

1. **Objective:** The goal of Crazy Eights is to be the first player to empty their hand of cards.

2. **Deck:** We use a standard deck of 52 cards. Each card has a suit (hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades) and a rank (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A). It is stored in cards.mjs.
3. **Starting:** At the beginning of the game, each player is dealt a hand of 5 cards, and one card is placed face-up on the table as the "starter" card.

4. **Gameplay:** Players take turns in clockwise order. On their turn, a player must play one card from their hand that matches the suit or rank of the starter card. If a player does not have a matching card, they must draw cards from the deck until they find a playable card.

5. **Crazy Eight:** The 8s are special cards. A player can play an 8 at any time, and they get to choose the suit for the next player to match.

6. **Winning:** The first player to play all their cards is declared the winner.
